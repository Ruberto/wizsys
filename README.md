# Magic 8.0

The wizarding world has been around for ages,
their system even more so.

The purpose of the code: To help students know what schools will help them improve
their interests(as you will come to know some schools are better than others, the same will be said of wizards & witches).

What the code is doing now.
A school has a list of courses(SCHOOL_DATA) and a list of ratings for each course (given by the united magic ratings agency on a scale from from 0 to 100).

A child when applying to the school should submit his name and at least 5 subjects he is interested in, the order of the subjects coincides with a list of all the subjects available(COURSES).

We compare the list of subjects a student submits with each subjects interest score(out of 10) with all the subjects from the different schools and their rating's. Then work out which school will be the best overall for the student.


The code is centuries old and needs a fair amount of refactoring.

Use all the knowledge at your disposal to manage the dependencies wisely.
